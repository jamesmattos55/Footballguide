## Handbook to the sport of football

**This app will be called The Football Handbook.

* The basic functionality of this app is to be a quick and seamless guide to 
the sport of football for people that want to understand what is going on.
the point of this app is to be able to open while watching a game and follow 
along and learn.

* The people who would find this useful, would be people who are new to football.
Maybe it will be a parent with kids that play, or a person whose friends watch it together
but they have no idea whats going on.

* This app is useful without using any sort of connection to the internet. The main
function of this app would be accesing data that is stored in the code so they can
find what they want to know easily.

* There are not current plans to have it access the internet at the moment, however
it might be useful to have links to videos or maybe even headlines for sports related news.
